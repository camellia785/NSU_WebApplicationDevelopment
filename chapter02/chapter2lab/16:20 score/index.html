      <p>
        Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and
        release wildlife back into their natural environment. We are a nonprofit
        organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We also
        provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back into
        their natural environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care for our
        animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become a sponsor.
        Contact us today.
