            <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>

            <p>
              Networking fundamentals are the invisible foundation of every
              modern application. In this site, you’ll build a clear, practical
              understanding of how data moves across the internet and how
              backend services communicate.
            </p>

            <p>By the end, you’ll be able to explain and work with:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                How the internet works at a high level (clients, servers,
                routers, packets)
              </li>
              <li>Core web protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS</li>
              <li>DNS and domain names, and how a URL becomes a real server</li>
              <li>
                Hosting and browsers, and how a request turns into a rendered
                page
              </li>
              <li>Transport concepts like TCP vs UDP and ports</li>
              <li>
                Essential security ideas: TLS/SSL, cookies, sessions, tokens,
                and common vulnerabilities
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The goal is not just memorizing terms, but being able to
              <strong>connect the dots</strong>: given a request from a browser
              or API client, you’ll understand what happens at each layer until
              the response is sent back.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div id="modal-home-backend" class="modal">
          <div class="modal-overlay" data-modal-close></div>
          <div class="modal-content">

              &times;
            </button>
            <h2>For Backend Developers</h2>
            <p>
              This site is designed with backend developers in mind. Writing
              controllers and database queries is only half the job — your code
              always lives inside a <strong>networked system</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              As you go through the content, you’ll see how networking concepts
              directly affect backend work:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Designing APIs that use HTTP methods and status codes correctly
              </li>
              <li>
                Understanding request/response lifecycles, timeouts, and retries
              </li>
              <li>
                Choosing between TCP and UDP–based services depending on your
                use case
              </li>
              <li>Handling authentication with cookies, sessions, and JWTs</li>
              <li>Protecting your services from common web attacks</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              You’ll also gain intuition for reading logs and debugging real
              issues, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>“Why is this request so slow?”</li>
              <li>
                “Is the problem in my app, the database, DNS, or the network?”
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              By the end, you won’t see the network as a black box anymore.
              You’ll be able to reason about architecture, communicate better
              with DevOps and SRE teams, and design backend systems that are
              more reliable and secure.
            </p>

          <div class="modal-overlay" data-modal-close></div>
          <div class="modal-content">
            <button class="modal-close" type="button" data-modal-close>
              &times;
            </button>
            <h2>Practical Knowledge</h2>
            <p>
              Theory is important, but networking only really “clicks” when you
              see it in action. Throughout this site, you’ll be encouraged to
              <strong>try things yourself</strong>, not just read.
            </p>

            <p>Examples of what you’ll practice:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Running a simple HTTP server and sending requests to it</li>
              <li>
                Inspecting requests and responses with browser DevTools or
                <code>curl</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                Looking up DNS records and understanding how a domain maps to an
                IP
              </li>
              <li>
                Experimenting with HTTPS and seeing how certificates work in the
                browser
              </li>
              <li>
                Observing how load balancing or reverse proxies change request
                flow
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Each topic is paired with concrete, backend-oriented scenarios, so
              you can connect concepts to real projects — for example, deploying
              an API, debugging CORS issues, or tracking down a failing login
              flow.
            </p>

            <p>
              The goal is for you to walk away with
              <strong>skills you can apply immediately</strong> in your backend
              work, not just abstract knowledge.
